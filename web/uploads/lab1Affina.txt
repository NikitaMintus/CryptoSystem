You can also upload multiple files at once, 
with some adjustments to the code listed in the previous subsections.

First you should adjust the model class by adding the maxFiles option in the file
 validation rule to limit the maximum number of files allowed to upload. 
Setting maxFiles to 0 means there is no limit on the number of files that
 can be uploaded simultaneously. The maximum number of files allowed to 
be uploaded simultaneously is also limited with PHP directive max_file_uploads,
 which defaults to 20. The upload() method should also be updated to save the
 uploaded files one by one.
